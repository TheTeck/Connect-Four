board // 2D array of (null, 1, or 2)
isGameOver // boolean to know if active game or it has ended
player // integer representing who is the active player
activeColumn // integer value set if mouse is hovered over a column
winningFour // array to hold the x and y of each winning chip

// Cached elements
boardEl // the entire board

// Eventlisteners
boardEl -> calls dropChip() on click
